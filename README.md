# Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree - Udacity
This repository contains programming assigments and projects for Udacity's Deep RL Nanodegree program.

## 1. Setup and usage
We would use dockerized env for execution the project files. The requirements stemming from [udacitys
 repo](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/blob/master/python/requirements.txt) are 
located [here](./Docker/requirements.txt)

Just update the requirements if necessary. After checking ut just run `docker-compose up -d jupyter` 
and the jupyter notebook server should be accessible on your localhost on port 8888. If necessary, 
you can modify the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml)
